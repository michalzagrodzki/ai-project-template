**Status:** Proposed / Accepted / Superseded / Deprecated
**Related Specification:** `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`
**Decision ID:** ADR-###

---

## 1. Context

Describe the background and motivation behind this decision.
Explain why this topic required a formal decision and what problem it addresses.

*Example:*

> Our authentication system currently stores sessions in-memory, which causes users to be logged out on every container restart.
> We need a persistent, scalable session solution that integrates easily with existing infrastructure.

---

## 2. Decision

Describe the specific choice that was made and the rationale behind it.
State it clearly and concisely as the official decision.

*Example:*

> We will use **Redis** as the primary session storage for all user authentication flows.
> Session TTL will be 3600s and configurable per environment.

---

## 3. Alternatives Considered

Describe other options that were evaluated, along with reasoning for rejecting them.
Keep explanations short but informative.

*Example alternatives:*

* **PostgreSQL sessions:** stable but slower under high load.
* **JWT-only approach:** stateless but lacks revocation control.
* **Memcached:** fast but lacks persistence.

---

## 4. Consequences

Describe the impact of this decision, both positive and negative.
List what changes or risks it introduces for the system.

*Example consequences:*
**Positive:**

* Session persistence across restarts
* Simple operational model with Redis
  **Negative:**
* Adds external dependency (Redis)
* Requires cache invalidation policies

---

## 5. Implementation Notes

Describe any technical details or configuration required to realize the decision.
This helps future developers apply or modify the decision correctly.

*Example notes:*

* Add Redis service to `docker-compose.yml`
* Set `REDIS_URL` and `SESSION_TTL` in `.env`
* Update `AuthService` and `Middleware` for persistence integration

---

## 6. Rollback / Supersession Plan

Describe how this decision can be reverted or replaced if future requirements change.
Reference any newer ADRs that might supersede this one.

*Example:*

> If Redis proves unstable, fall back to PostgreSQL-backed session table.
> Superseded ADRs will be linked under the `Supersedes` field.
