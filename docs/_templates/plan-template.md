# Implementation Plan — <Feature Name>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Author:** <Your Name>
**Related Specification:** `docs/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`
**Status:** Draft / In Progress / Final

---

## 1. Purpose

Describe why this implementation plan exists and what it aims to achieve.
It should directly map to the approved specification and show how the implementation will progress in small, testable steps.

*Example:*

> This plan details how to introduce Redis-based session storage incrementally without breaking existing login flows.
> Each step will leave the application in a working state and will include test instructions.

---

## 2. Overview

Describe the overall approach, guiding principles, and key assumptions before coding starts.
Mention design constraints, testing goals, and rollback expectations.

*Example overview:*

* Incremental rollout: one component per step
* Each stage ends with a working, testable build
* Add new Redis service and update auth layer gradually
* Rollback possible by removing Redis config and reverting to in-memory sessions

---

## 3. Step-by-Step Plan

Describe each implementation step in detail.
Every step should include expected file changes, configuration updates, and how to test that step.

*Example structure:*

### Step 1 — Add Redis Service

**Description:**
Add Redis container and environment configuration for session persistence.

**Changes:**

* Update `docker-compose.yml`
* Add `REDIS_URL` to `.env`
* Configure connection test command in backend

**Files to Modify:**

```text
docker-compose.yml
.env
services/auth/config.py
```

**How to Test:**

* Run `docker compose up`
* Verify Redis is reachable via `redis-cli ping`
* App still boots without runtime errors

---

### Step 2 — Add Session Storage Layer

**Description:**
Introduce a `SessionStore` class to handle session CRUD operations.

**Changes:**

* Create `services/auth/session_store.py`
* Implement `create_session()`, `get_session()`, `delete_session()`
* Unit tests for the new class

**Files to Modify:**

```text
services/auth/session_store.py
tests/auth/test_session_store.py
```

**How to Test:**

* Run `pytest tests/auth/test_session_store.py`
* Verify all tests pass
* No change in user-visible behavior yet

---

### Step 3 — Integrate Middleware

**Description:**
Hook the new session storage into request middleware.

**Changes:**

* Modify `AuthMiddleware` to read/write via `SessionStore`
* Add logging for fallback to JWT-only mode

**Files to Modify:**

```text
services/api/middleware/auth_guard.py
services/auth/session_store.py
```

**How to Test:**

* Start local server and login
* Restart backend container
* Confirm session persists (no re-login required)

---

### Step 4 — Add Configuration and Monitoring

**Description:**
Expose session metrics and configuration options.

**Changes:**

* Add environment variables for TTL and metrics toggle
* Update `Prometheus` metrics to include Redis hit/miss

**Files to Modify:**

```text
.env
services/auth/config.py
services/metrics/redis_metrics.py
```

**How to Test:**

* Check `/metrics` endpoint for Redis counters
* Adjust TTL and confirm session expiry matches configuration

---

### Step 5 — Final Cleanup & Tests

**Description:**
Consolidate code, finalize documentation, and confirm readiness for release.

**Changes:**

* Update `README.md` with Redis setup instructions
* Add final integration tests
* Remove temporary debug logs

**How to Test:**

* Run full test suite
* Verify CI build is green
* Manual smoke test of login/logout flow

---

## 4. Rollback Plan

Describe how to revert safely if an issue occurs in production.
This should include both code and configuration steps.

*Example:*

* Revert to previous commit
* Remove `REDIS_URL` from `.env`
* Comment out Redis service in `docker-compose.yml`
* Restart backend with in-memory session fallback

---

## 5. Definition of Done

Describe the final success criteria confirming the implementation is complete and production-ready.

*Example checklist:*

* [ ] All planned steps implemented and verified
* [ ] Each step’s tests passed (local + CI)
* [ ] No regressions on authentication or session flow
* [ ] Performance within targets (≤100ms average session lookup)
* [ ] Documentation (README + spec) updated
* [ ] Feature flagged or released to production
* [ ] ADR updated (if applicable)

---

## 6. Post-Implementation Validation

Describe how to validate the solution after merging, including runtime verification and observability checks.

*Example validation plan:*

* Monitor logs for Redis connection issues
* Check metrics dashboard for session cache hits/misses
* Verify CI/CD pipeline deployment logs
* Confirm rollback readiness checklist

---

## 7. Lessons Learned (Optional)

Describe any insights, tradeoffs, or improvements discovered during development.
This section can be updated post-release to inform future designs.

*Example notes:*

> Redis key eviction was more aggressive than expected in test environments; increased TTL to avoid premature session loss.
> Middleware refactoring made testability much easier.
